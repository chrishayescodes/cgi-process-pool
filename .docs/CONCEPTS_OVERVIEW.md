# CGI Process Pool - Core Concepts Overview

## 🧠 Fundamental Computer Science Concepts

This project demonstrates several key computer science and systems engineering concepts working together. Understanding these concepts will help you recognize similar patterns in modern web infrastructure.

## 🔄 Process Management & System Programming

### The Process Lifecycle
Every program on your computer is a **process** - a running instance of code with its own memory space.

```
Process States: Created → Ready → Running → Blocked → Terminated
                   ↑         ↓         ↑        ↓
                   └─────── Scheduler ──────────┘
```

**In Our System:**
- `pool/manager.py` creates child processes for each CGI service
- Each process maintains its own HTTP server loop
- Parent process monitors children and restarts them if they die

**Why This Matters:**
- **Isolation**: If one service crashes, others keep running
- **Concurrency**: Multiple requests can be handled simultaneously  
- **Resource Management**: Each process has defined memory/CPU limits

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
Processes need ways to communicate. We use several IPC mechanisms:

```
1. Network Sockets (TCP/IP)
   Client ←→ Proxy ←→ CGI Process

2. Process Signals (POSIX)
   Manager → SIGTERM → Child Process (graceful shutdown)
   Manager → SIGKILL → Child Process (force kill)

3. File System
   Config files, logs, PID files
```

**Learning Opportunity:** Study `ops/process_manager.py` to see signal handling:
```python
def _signal_handler(self, signum, frame):
    """Handle shutdown signals gracefully"""
    print(f"Received signal {signum}, initiating graceful shutdown...")
    self.shutdown_all()
```

## 🌐 Network Programming & HTTP

### TCP Socket Programming
The foundation of all network communication:

```
Server Side:                    Client Side:
socket() → bind() → listen()    socket() → connect()
    ↓                              ↓
accept() ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ←
    ↓                              ↓
recv() ← ← ← ← data ← ← ← ← ← ← send()
    ↓                              ↑
send() → → → → data → → → → → → recv()
```

**In Our System:**
- Each CGI process creates a TCP socket and listens on a port
- YARP proxy connects to these sockets to forward requests
- HTTP protocol runs on top of TCP

**Study This:** Look at `discovery/samples/c/search.c`:
```c
int server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
bind(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address, sizeof(address));
listen(server_fd, 3);
accept(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address, (socklen_t*)&addrlen);
```

### HTTP Protocol Deep Dive
HTTP is just structured text sent over TCP:

```
Request:
GET /api/search?q=test HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: curl/7.68.0

Response:  
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 156

{"results": [{"id": 1, "title": "Test Result"}]}
```

**Key Learning:** Our C services parse HTTP manually, showing you what web frameworks do automatically.

## ⚖️ Load Balancing & Distributed Systems

### Load Balancing Algorithms

**Round Robin** (what we implement):
```
Request 1 → Process A
Request 2 → Process B  
Request 3 → Process C
Request 4 → Process A (cycles back)
```

**Other Algorithms You Could Implement:**
- **Least Connections**: Route to process with fewest active connections
- **Weighted**: Give some processes more traffic than others
- **Health-Based**: Avoid routing to unhealthy processes

**Study This:** YARP proxy configuration in `proxy/CGIProxy/appsettings.json`

### Health Checking & Circuit Breakers
How do you know if a service is working?

```
Health Check Types:
1. TCP Port Check: Can we connect?
2. HTTP Health Endpoint: Does /health return 200?
3. Application-Level: Does the app logic work?
```

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
```
Closed (Normal) → Open (Failing) → Half-Open (Testing) → Closed
     ↑                ↓                   ↓              ↑
   Working         Failing            Test Request    Working Again
```

## 🏗️ Software Architecture Patterns

### Microservices Architecture
Instead of one big application, we have many small services:

```
Monolith:                  Microservices:
┌─────────────────┐       ┌───────┐ ┌───────┐ ┌───────┐
│                 │       │Search │ │ Auth  │ │Python │
│  All Features   │  VS   │Service│ │Service│ │Service│
│                 │       │       │ │       │ │       │
└─────────────────┘       └───────┘ └───────┘ └───────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Technology diversity (C, Python, C# services)
- Fault isolation
- Team autonomy

### The Proxy Pattern
A proxy sits between client and server, intercepting requests:

```
Client → Proxy → Server
         ↓
    Add features:
    - Load balancing
    - SSL termination  
    - Rate limiting
    - Authentication
    - Monitoring
```

**Study This:** `proxy/CGIProxy/Program.cs` shows YARP configuration

### Configuration-Driven Design
Instead of hard-coding behavior, use configuration files:

```csharp
// Bad: Hard-coded
var backend = "http://localhost:8000";

// Good: Configuration-driven  
var backend = configuration["Backend:Url"];
```

**In Our System:**
- `discovery/manifest.json` - What services exist
- `ops/process_config.json` - How to run them
- `languages/definitions.json` - What languages are supported

## 🎯 Concurrency & Parallelism

### The Difference
- **Concurrency**: Dealing with many things at once (task switching)
- **Parallelism**: Doing many things at once (multiple cores)

### Our Approach: Process-Based Concurrency
```
Process Pool Model:
Request 1 → Process A (CPU Core 1)
Request 2 → Process B (CPU Core 2)  
Request 3 → Process C (CPU Core 1) - context switch
Request 4 → Process A (CPU Core 2) - process available
```

**Alternative Approaches:**
- **Thread-Based**: Multiple threads in one process
- **Event-Driven**: Single thread with async I/O (Node.js style)
- **Actor Model**: Isolated actors passing messages (Erlang style)

### Why Process Pools Work Well
```
Advantages:
✅ Strong isolation (crash doesn't affect others)
✅ Simple programming model  
✅ Automatic load distribution
✅ Easy monitoring and management

Disadvantages:
❌ Higher memory usage than threads
❌ Inter-process communication overhead
❌ OS limits on process count
```

## 🔧 Systems Engineering Concepts

### The "12-Factor App" Principles
Our system demonstrates many principles of cloud-native applications:

1. **Codebase**: One codebase, multiple deployments
2. **Dependencies**: Explicit dependency declarations (`languages/definitions.json`)
3. **Config**: Configuration in environment/files, not code
4. **Backing Services**: Services treated as attached resources
5. **Processes**: App as stateless processes
6. **Port Binding**: Services bind to ports and serve requests
7. **Concurrency**: Scale via process model
8. **Disposability**: Fast startup, graceful shutdown
9. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams
10. **Admin Processes**: Run admin tasks as one-off processes

### Observability: The Three Pillars

**Metrics** (Quantitative):
```python
request_count = 1247
response_time_avg = 23.5ms  
error_rate = 0.02%
```

**Logs** (Events):  
```
2024-01-15 10:30:15 INFO Request received: GET /api/search?q=test
2024-01-15 10:30:15 INFO Process PID 1234 handling request
2024-01-15 10:30:15 INFO Response sent: 200 OK (15ms)
```

**Traces** (Request Flow):
```
Request ID: abc123
└─ Proxy: 2ms
   └─ CGI Process: 13ms
      └─ Business Logic: 11ms
      └─ Response Generation: 2ms
```

**Study This:** `proxy/CGIProxy/` shows structured logging and metrics

### Infrastructure as Code
Instead of manual setup, everything is defined in code:

```bash
# Traditional: Manual setup
sudo apt install nginx
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/default  
sudo systemctl start nginx

# Our approach: Code-defined
make start  # Everything configured automatically
```

## 🎪 Performance & Scalability Concepts

### The C10K Problem
How can a server handle 10,000 concurrent connections?

**Traditional Approach (doesn't scale):**
```
1 Connection = 1 Thread = 2MB memory
10,000 connections = 20GB memory just for threads!
```

**Modern Approaches:**
1. **Event-Driven I/O**: One thread handles thousands of connections
2. **Process Pools**: Fixed number of processes handle requests
3. **Async Programming**: Non-blocking I/O operations

Our system uses approach #2 - process pools with a reasonable number of workers.

### Scalability Patterns

**Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling:**
```
Vertical (Scale Up):           Horizontal (Scale Out):
┌─────────────┐               ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐
│             │               │     │ │     │ │     │
│ Bigger      │   VS          │ More│ │ More│ │ More│
│ Machine     │               │     │ │     │ │     │
│             │               └─────┘ └─────┘ └─────┘
└─────────────┘
```

Our system supports both:
- **Vertical**: Increase processes per machine
- **Horizontal**: Run on multiple machines (behind load balancer)

### Caching Strategies
Where can we cache data to improve performance?

```
1. Browser Cache: Static assets
2. CDN: Geographic distribution  
3. Proxy Cache: Reverse proxy caching
4. Application Cache: In-memory data
5. Database Cache: Query result caching
```

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Concepts

### Types of Testing in Our System

**Unit Tests**: Individual components
```bash
# Test single CGI process
./build/search.cgi 9999 &
curl "http://localhost:9999/?q=test"
```

**Integration Tests**: Components working together
```bash
# Test proxy + pool integration
make start
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?q=test"
```

**Load Tests**: Performance under stress
```bash
./testing/stress_test.sh -c 100 -t 1000
```

**Smoke Tests**: Basic functionality after deployment
```bash
make smoke-test
```

### Chaos Engineering
Intentionally breaking things to test resilience:

```bash
# Kill random processes and observe recovery
make start
kill -9 $(pgrep search.cgi | head -1)
make status  # Should show automatic recovery
```
